Phi@I presents  **MEMEATICA** as part of the Schrodinger Week 2020.

Do you have what it takes to be a Memelord?
We're looking for dank physics memes, and we know that the IISER-M Memers community won't shy away from our challenge.

Also, didn't we mention?
A prize worth Rs.300 is waiting for the perfect meme!

## Rules

1. You have to submit your design as a PNG/JPEG file. Please keep a good resolution in your submissions.

2. Make sure that the meme is original. Any evidence of plagiarism with lead to disqualification.

3. The last date for submission is 21st August 2020, 12 midnight.

4. Avoid memes that can be offensive to people or to a group of people.

This time the jury for the competition will be the students of IISER Mohali. Yes, you read it right! We'll put up all the designs we would get online, and people will vote for their favourite designs. The design which gets the most votes would be declared the winner.
