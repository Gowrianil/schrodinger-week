# GALACTIQUEST - THE SPACE ADVENTURE

We know that some people may not have a stable internet connection, so the whole game is offline. You can however use the internet to solve the clues!

The event starts at 6pm on Saturday 23rd August. Play time should be around 3 hours. Those who cannot make it on that day can also play it at any later time, but will obviously miss the prizes (WORTH 1200!)  

We also acknowledge The Turing Club for their contributions in this event.

**LINKS AND FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS WOULD BE PUT UP AT 6 P.M ON 23RD AUGUST.**
We advise you to be ready with supplies for your space mission (Chips and Coke are fine!)
