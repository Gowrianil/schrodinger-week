![](Schrodinger_Week.jpg)


Keeping up with our yearly promise, Phi@I is back with its flagship event **Schrodinger's Week 2020** to kick of the semester on a high note.

And Keeping up with the situation, all our competitions are online.

We still have the old classics, Hackathon - **Code The Matrix**, and a Virtual Treasure Hunt(~~shamelessly copied from~~ inspired by Turing Club) **GalactiQuest- A Space Adventure**, but this year, we've also tried to come up with new and original online events, **Explain Like I am Five** and **Particle In A Box**.

We also have events on themes of _Science meets Art_, which will run throughout the week, Meme Making - **MEMEATICA**, **T-Shirt Design**, and **Frame It** - An online photography competition with Lumiere.

And that all too with cash prizes worth Rs 5000!

We kick it off on **Monday(17th August)** by a webinar by **Dr.Rulands** from the _Max-Planck Institute, Germany_.

We hope you all enjoy it!
