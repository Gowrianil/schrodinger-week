Phi@I presents to you our annual TEE DESIGN CONTEST.
We want you to submit a cool, original, wacky Tee Design, which can become the face of our club for the year to be.

## Prizes
The winner just doesn't just have a chance to get featured on the official Phi@I Tee, they get to win an absolutely free high quality Tee of their own design.


## Rules for Submission

1. You have to submit your design as a PNG/TIF file and your design must have a resolution of atleast 300ppi.

2. Make sure that the design doesn't have any translucent elements.

3. Make sure that the design is original. Any evidence of plagiarism will automatically lead to disqualification.

4. The last date for submission is 21st August 2020, 12 midnight.


## Grading

This time the jury for the competition will be the students of IISER Mohali. We'll upload all the designs we would get on the portal, so that people can vote for their favourite designs.

**Yes, you read it right!**

Going according to democratic principles, the design which gets the most votes would be declared the winner.

So get ready and get creative!
